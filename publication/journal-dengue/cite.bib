abstract="Developers often have to locate design problems in the source code. Several types of design problems may manifest as code smells in the program. A code smell is a source code structure that may reveal a partial hint about the manifestation of a design problem. Recent studies suggest that developers should ignore smells occurring in isolation in a program location. Instead, they should focus on analyzing stinkier code, i.e., program locations---e.g., a class or a hierarchy---affected by multiple smells. There is evidence that the stinkier a program location is, the more likely it contains a design problem. However, there is no empirical evidence on whether developers can effectively identify a design problem in stinkier code. Developers may struggle to make an analysis of inter-related smells affecting the same program location. Besides that, the analysis of stinkier code may require proper tool support due to its analysis complexity. However, there is little knowledge on what are the requirements for a tool that helps developers in revealing stinkier program locations. As a result, developers may not be able to identify design problems due to tool issues.",
