      <description>ReSoM: Rejuvenescimento de Software Multi-Linguagem - Maintenance and evolution are frequent talks in the software development. As the system is modified, architectural problems are either introduced or amplified, resulting in the decrease of the software quality. Given this scenario, the following research question addresses the main goals of this project: How to support the developers to solve architectural problems in the source code? This question leads to identification of a set of code smells that are indicators of architectural problems in the systems developed in one or more programming language.</description>

      <description>Award received for an authored ICSE paper regarding a theory on the identification of design problems in the source code. ICSE is the world&amp;rsquo;s main conference in the field of software engineering. In 40 years of ICSE this was the second time that a paper from Brazil receives such distinction.

      <description>Award received for a co-authored SBCARS paper regarding how developers can effectively find design problems when reflecting upon stinky code. The Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS) is promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and attracts researchers, students, and practitioners interested in a broad range of software engineering topics, including software product lines, component-based development, architectures, and reuse.
