        <p class="text-justify">
            When a software design decision has a negative impact on one or more quality attributes, we call it a design problem. For example, the Fat Interface problem indicates that an interface exposes non-cohesive services. Thus, clients and implementations of this interface may have to handle with services that they are not interested. A design problem such as this hampers the extensibility and maintainability of a software system. As illustrated by the example, a single design problem often affects several elements in the program. Despite its harmfulness, it is difficult to identify a design problem in a system. It is even more challenging to identify design problems when the source code is the only available artifact. In particular, no study has observed what strategy(ies) developers use in practice to identify design problems when the design documentation is unavailable. In order to address this gap, we conducted a qualitative analysis on how developers identify design problems in two different scenarios: when they are either <strong>familiar</strong> (Scenario 1) or <strong>unfamiliar</strong> (Scenario 2) with the analyzed systems. Developers familiar with the systems applied a diverse set of strategies during the identification of each design problem. Some strategies were frequently used to locate code elements for analysis, and other strategies were frequently used to confirm design problems in these elements. Developers unfamiliar with the systems relied only on the use of code smells along the task. Despite some differences among the subjects from both scenarios, we noticed that developers often search for multiple indicators during the identification of each design problem.

        <h3 class="page-header" id="scenarios">Studied Scenarios and Subjects</h3>
        We conducted a series of controlled experiments to observe how developers identify design problems in the source code. In order to conduct the study, we observed devlopers in two scenarios:
        
        
        <h4><u>Scenario 1: Developers that are familiar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>
        
        <p class="text-justify"> 
            The first scenario comprises developers allocated to identify design problems in systems with which they are familiar, i.e., systems that they implemented. In order to select developers
            for this scenario, we searched for software companies that could provide us with: (i) developers, and (ii) systems in dierent stages of design degradation.
            We selected two software companies, in which provided us five software systems. Table I summarizes the characterization of the software companies.</p>

        <h4><u>Scenario 2: Developers that are unfamiliar with the analyzed systems</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The second scenario comprises developers assigned to identify design problems in systems with which they are unfamiliar, i.e., systems that they did not implement. 
            In order to select developers for this scenario, we recruited a set of developers, and we asked them to answer a questionnaire. The goal was to determine which of 
            them were eligible to be subject in the study. The questionnaire covers information to characterize the developers about their education level and knowledge of Java programming.
            In order to select a subject for the study, he would need to meet some requirements.Thus, we analyzed their answers based on the following requirements:

            <ol>

                <li>R1. Four years or more of experience with software development and maintenance. We have chosen four years because this is the average time used by companies such
                    as Yahoo <a href="#yahoo">(Yahoo, 2017)</a> and Twitter <a href="#twitter">(Twitter, 2017)</a> to classify a developer as experienced.</li>

                <li>R2. No previous knowledge about Pushu Pull (P6) and Workflow Manager (P7).</li>

                <li>R3. At least intermediary knowledge on Java programming. </li>

            </ol>

        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            We included in the questionnaire a description of our definition of knowledge level, thereby allowing developers to have a similar interpretation of the possible answers.
            Table III presents the definition of knowledge level that developers received.

            We selected two systems from the <a href="http://oodt.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache OODT</a> project (Push Pull and Workflow Manager), and we asked subjects of Scenario 2 to identify design problems in these systems. We selected these systems because they have a well-defined set of design problems identified by developers who actually implemented the systems. We gave them a document containing: (i) a brief description of Push Pull (S6) and Workflow Manager (S7), and (ii) a very high level description of their design blueprint. We gave them these documents because when they have to maintain unfamiliar systems, they need to have some minimal information about the systems to be maintained. We used the same document provided in the OODT project. Document with the description of both systems can be downloaded at <a href="download/oodtdoc.zip">here</a>.

        <h3 class="page-header" id="dp">Design Problems and Code Smells</h3>

        <p class="text-justify>">
            We conducted a qualitative study to observe how developers identify design problems in the source code. We provided developers with an initial list of code smells affecting the systems. The developers had the freedom to use or not the initial list of code smells. Thus, we could investigate if developers rely on code smells as a dominant strategy to identify design problems and to what extent they can identify design problem using code smells. Following we present the design problems and the code smells used in our study.
        </p>

        <h4><u>Design Problems</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            A design problem is a part of the software design (a design fragment) that negatively impacts one or more quality attributes, such as comprehensibility, maintainability and performance <a href="#bar">(Bar, 1998)</a>;<a href="#ciupke">Ciupke, 1999</a>;<a href="suryanarayana">Suryanarayana 2014</a>;<a href="#trifu">Trifu, 2007)</a>. In order to support developers during the identification of design problems, we provided them a guide characterizing different types of design problems at the beginning of the task (Activity 2 - Problem identification). This guide contains a brief description of the design problems used in the training activity. We highlight that we let clear to developers that they were allowed to identify other types of design problems. Following we present the design problems used in the study (including the design problems provided in the training as well as other types of design problems found by the subjects), as well as the description used to create the guide.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ambiguous Interface (AMI):</strong> Interface of a design component that offers only a general, ambiguous entry-point that provides non-cohesive services, thereby complicating the clients' logic.</li>

            <li><strong>Cyclic Dependency (CCD):</strong> Two or more design components that directly or indirectly depend on each other.</li>

            <li><strong>Component Overload (CCO):</strong> Design components that fulfill too many responsibilities.</li>

            <li><strong>Component Overload (CCP):</strong> Design components that fulfill too many responsibilities.</li>

            <li><strong>Delegating Abstraction (DLA):</strong> An abstraction that exists only for passing messages from one abstraction to another.</li>

            <li><strong>Fat Interface (FTI):</strong> Interface that is overloaded with many clients accessing it. That is, an interface with "too many clients".</li>

            <li><strong>Incomplete Abstraction (ICA):</strong> when an element does not support a responsibility completely in their enclosing component.

            <li><strong>Misplaced Concern (MPC):</strong> element that implements a concern (e.g. functionality), which is not the predominant one of their enclosing component

            <li><strong>Unwanted Dependency (UWD):</strong> Dependency that violates an intended design rule.</li>

            <li><strong>Scattered Concern (STC):</strong> Multiple components that are responsible for realizing a crosscutting concern.</li>


        </ul>

        <h4><u>Code Smells</u></h4>

        <p class="text-justify">
            A code smell is a structure in the implementation of the program that possibly indicates a design problem <a href="#fowler">(Fowler, 1999)</a>. In this study, the subjects received a list of code smells affecting the systems. The list comprises a set of 15 types of code smells. We present the definition of the code smells following:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blob Class:</strong> Long and complex class that centralizes the intelligence of the system.</li>

            <li><strong>Class Data Should Be Private:</strong> A class exposing its fields, violating the principle of data hiding.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Complex Class:</strong> A class having at least one method having a high cyclomatic complexity.</li>

            <li><strong>Data Class:</strong> A class has this code smell when it has only fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else. The aim is to hold data and, consequently, be manipulated by other classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Divergent Change:</strong> This code smell occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons.</li>

            <li><strong>Feature Envy:</strong> Feature envy occurs in a class when the method of that class seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually belongs.</li>

            <li><strong>God Class:</strong> This code smell occurs when the class centralizes more the one functionality, realizing more than one purpose.</li>

            <li><strong>Lazy Class: A class having very small dimension, few methods and with low complexity.</strong> </li>

            <li><strong>Long Method:</strong> This code smell occurs when a method has grown too large, containing too many lines of code.</li>

            <li><strong>Long Parameter List:</strong> This code smell occurs in a method that has a long list of parameters, in which makes readability and code quality worse.</li>

            <li><strong>Message Chain:</strong> A long chain of method invocations is performed to implement a class functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Refused Bequest:</strong> A subclass that uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents.</li>

            <li><strong>Shotgun Surgery:</strong> This code smell is the opposite of Divergent Change. It happens when every time a kind of change is made in the code, that change triggers many little changes in many different classes.</li>

            <li><strong>Spaghetti Code:</strong> A class implementing complex methods interacting with them, with no parameters, using global variables.</li>

            <li><strong>Speculative Generality:</strong> A class declared as abstract having very few children classes that use its methods.</li>

        </ul>
